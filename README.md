This is my first project using JS that I created with the motive
of learning more about JS and React.





## Installation

Create react app with npx

```bash
npx create-react-app (your-app-name)
```

But i recommend to use the clone of react-mini repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/safak/youtube.git .
```
It provides you with only the necessary files.

Install the node modules 

```bash
npm install
```
